**Asteroid 2007 VW266** was discovered on 12 November 2007 (UT) by the Mt. Lemmon Survey. Analysis of its orbit reveals a retrograde and inclined trajectory close to Jupiter, meaning that it is moving in the opposite direction to the giant planet.

This type of orbit is unusual, as it is generally unstable. This is why [M. Connors and P. Wiegert](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018P%26SS..151...71C/abstract) have studied the characteristics of this trajectory and the mechanisms that explain its stability.

In their article, they show that the asteroid is in **resonance with Jupiter**, which enables it to temporarily stabilise its orbit. Their study details its orbital parameters, which we are going to analyse in order to find and verify their results.
