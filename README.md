# Retrograde-asteroid-near-Jupiter
This Python project aims to reproduce the results obtained in the article ‘A retrograde object near Jupiter's orbit’ written by M. Connors and P. Wiegert. This article studies asteroid 2007 VW266, whose orbit is in temporary retrograde resonance with Jupiter. The results show that the asteroid will leave this orbit in about 8000 years.
